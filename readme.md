<h1>SBA 307.2 Chris Puntier</h1>
<h2>This assignment is meant to be used as a resource for learning characters from Street Fighter 6. Right now the only two chacarters supported are Ryu and Chun-Li.</h2>
<h2>The index.html page is the homepage giving users a brief introduction and a character selection. The user will see the character on the corresponding side. There is also a feedback form on the bottom.</h2>
<h2>Once a character is chosen use will see a character page with a short description of the character along with the characters special move list. Super moves are not yet implemented.</h2>
<h2> Nav bar is included on top for easy character switching, being able to return to home page, and a search bar to be implemented in the future hopefully.</h2>
<h2>Tables are meant to be easy to use and colors have been chosen to match with the character.</h2>
